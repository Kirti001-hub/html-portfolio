<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Kirti Gupta, and I’m currently pursuing my studies in engineering. Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in software development and problem-solving. I already have a good grasp of C++, and I’m gradually expanding my knowledge into cybersecurity and IoT-based solutions. My curiosity for technology also extends toward building innovative projects, especially in areas like healthcare, security, and education.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I’m deeply passionate about writing and storytelling. I love creating unique narratives-especially in genres like friendship-driven contemporary stories and supernatural fiction. Writing from a female perspective allows me to explore emotions and relationships in a way that feels personal and authentic.</p>

<p>I also enjoy drawing which often complements my storytelling since many of my story ideas begin as sketches. On the professional side while on the entrepreneurial side, I’m motivated to start a unique healthcare-focused startup that tackles challenges like anxiety, depression and overthinking in a meaningful way</p>

<p>As a person, I’d describe myself as curious, creative and determined. I enjoy brainstorming innovative ideas, collaborating with peoplem and finding new ways to solve problems—whether in technology or everyday life.</p>
